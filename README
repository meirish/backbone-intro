LSTN uses the node implementation of rdio-simple (https://github.com/rdio/rdio-simple) 
for oauth authentication and API calls.

Requirements
=================
node.js
npm
strata.js (formerly link.js)
( just `npm install strata` will get you there once you have node and npm )

Also for the OAUTH to work properly, you'll need an RDIO API key.
Sign up for one at http://developer.rdio.com. 
Create an application and put the key and secret in the 
file `rdio_consumer_credentials_EXAMPLE.js` and save it as `rdio_consumer_credentials.js`


Once you have that, `cd` into the `node` dir and run `node app.js`.

Then go to http://localhost:1982 to see the app.
